# Community Guidelines
SoCon is the largest online community where people share real thoughts and feelings, without identities. We are leading a global movement that believes happiness starts when you get to be your real self. To keep our community safe, we enforce our Golden Rule: **Don't be Mean, Don't be Gross, and Don't Use SoCon to Break the Law.**
## Don’t Be Mean
- Bullying is not allowed on SoCon. Don’t defame, impersonate, or abuse another person.
- Don’t share personal information about another person, including addresses or phone numbers.
- Hate speech targeted towards any group of people will be removed from our services. This includes hateful speech on the basis of gender, sexuality, race, religion, and ethnicity.
## Don’t Be Gross
- You can use your own pictures on SoCon but we don’t allow posts that are gross, gory, or pornographic.
## Don’t Use SoCon to Break the Law
- Please don’t post pictures you don’t have the rights to. If you are not sure, don’t post it.
- Don’t post nude or intimate pictures.
- Do not use SoCon to engage in or promote illegal behavior such as selling controlled substances or solicitation.
- If you solicit minors for any reason or post sexually explicit pictures of minors, we will suspend your account and report you to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
- Do not make threats of violence, we may share your IP address, location, and other information with law enforcement if we think you have made a threat to the safety of others.
- We can be required by law to disclose your information if we receive a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.
We actively moderate the service and ban users who violate these rules. We reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content for violating these guidelines or for any reason, but particularly to protect our users and community.
We treat references to self-harm and eating disorders seriously. Any posts glorifying these issues will be deleted. We invite you to visit [YourVoice.org](http://yourvoice.org), our non-profit dedicated to eradicating the stigma around mental health issues.
Thanks for using SoCon and being a part of our Community.
