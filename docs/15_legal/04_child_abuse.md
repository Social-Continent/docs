# Child Sexual Exploitation Policy

There is a zero-tolerance child sexual exploitation policy on the Social Continent. We have no tolerance towards any material or content that features or promotes child sexual exploitation in any way, including media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. Regardless of the intent, a user that views, shares or links to child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimization of the depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimization of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation. Under this policy, a minor or child is any person under the age of 18. 

## Content that violates this policy: 

Any and all content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation including, but not limited to: 
- Visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts;
- Illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually explicit context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts; 
- Sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor; and
- Links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material.

Additionally, the following conduct is also prohibited:
- Sharing fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation;
- Expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation;
- Recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes;
- Sending sexually explicit media to a child;
- Engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation;
- Trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child or trying to engage a child in sexual activity through blackmail or other incentives;
- Identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image; and
- Promoting or normalizing sexual attraction to minors as a form of identity or sexual orientation.
