# Law Enforcement

## Users
If you are engaged in a private message with another user on the SoCon app and feel you are in imminent danger or are concerned about the safety of another person, please contact your local law enforcement agency directly.
## Law Enforcement Response Guide
This guide outlines SoCon's procedures for responding, in accordance with Indian law, to legal processes and requests for information about SoCon and SoCon app users from Indian governmental entities. This guide does not apply to legal processes or requests from non-governmental domestic entities such as civil litigants or from foreign government agencies or litigants.
This Guide is published for SoCon's convenience and for informational purposes only. SoCon reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to deviate from the practices and standards outlined herein, and nothing in this Guide should be construed as creating any right or the basis for a claim by a third party, including a governmental entity, or as a promise that SoCon will act in a specific manner under any particular circumstances.
## About SoCon
The SoCon app allows users to communicate anonymously by posting content for public viewing and sending private messages. While most content on the SoCon app is posted publicly and can be viewed by anyone, including law enforcement, at any time, SoCon takes user privacy seriously and adheres to its Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
## Requirements to Compel User Information
SoCon, being an Indian company, requires valid legal process from an Indian governmental entity or court. Except in certain emergency situations described below and consistent with its Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, SoCon does not disclose user information or communication content unless presented with a valid subpoena, court order, or other legal processes issued by a competent Indian authority.
## What Information Does SoCon Store?
SoCon records may include:
- Nicknames
- Creation date
- Last login date
- IP address
- Device type
- Location information (geo lat/long or IP address)
- Content of posts
SoCon assigns a non-unique nickname to each user. Location information may not always be available, for example, when not transmitted to SoCon. SoCon may retain, for a limited period, IP addresses associated with devices that accessed the app, but cannot match posted content with an exact IP address. Private messages among users are not stored. SoCon stores publicly posted content and usage data in accordance with its Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
## How to Submit Law Enforcement Requests
Indian governmental entities must submit specific information that SoCon needs to search its stored data. Because SoCon does not collect personally identifying information or assign unique nicknames, it may not be able to identify any particular user based solely on information related to a public post. To facilitate law enforcement requests, include:
- The user's SoCon nickname(s) (case-sensitive) with an explanation of how the nickname(s) came under scrutiny;
- An image of the userâ€™s public post or the exact text of the post, or the unique URL for the public post;
- The specific information requested and its relationship to the investigation;
- The date by which a response is needed.
SoCon can preserve records or information in response to preservation requests as per Indian statutes.
## How to Submit Life-Threatening Emergencies
SoCon may disclose information to Indian governmental entities when there is a good faith belief that an emergency involving imminent danger requires immediate disclosure.
Requesting entities should provide:
- A summary of the emergency;
- An explanation of the urgent nature of the situation;
- How the requested information relates to the emergency;
- Why the situation precludes obtaining a legal process.
Contact details for the requesting authority must also be provided.
## Child Safety
SoCon reports any apparent instances of child exploitation to the appropriate Indian authorities. If a request relates to child exploitation or safety, please specify those circumstances for prioritization.
## User Notice of Governmental Entity Legal Process and Requests
Unless prohibited by Indian law, SoCon may notify affected users of legal processes or requests for their information, consistent with its Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
## Cost Reimbursement
Pursuant to Indian law, SoCon may seek reimbursement for costs incurred in searching for, assembling, reproducing, or providing user information in response to compulsory law enforcement process.
## Law Enforcement Response Guide Disclaimer
This guide is for informational purposes and does not waive any legal rights of SoCon or create any enforceable rights for third parties.
