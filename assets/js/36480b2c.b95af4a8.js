The foundational contract, Ownable, establishes a straightforward ownership mechanism, empowering the designated owner to undertake crucial actions like ownership transfer. The ERC2771Context augments the contracts with support for gasless meta-transactions, aligning with the EIP-2771 standard. This feature enables users to interact with the smart contract without direct gas fee payment. The Context contract, providing essential information about the contract's operational context, is leveraged for various purposes, including access control and logging. AccessControl further fortifies security, offering a flexible access control mechanism by defining roles and assigning permissions. The ERC721 standard is incorporated to represent unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within SoCon, signifying as SoCon Names and facilitating functionalities such as minting and transfer. Lastly, the Pausable contract introduces a pausing mechanism, allowing the contract owner to temporarily disable specific functions in emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the decentralized applications built on SoCon. This comprehensive integration of OpenZeppelin standards underscores SoCon's commitment to a robust, user-friendly, and secure web3 identity ecosystem."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"These contracts collectively serve as the infrastructure supporting the registration and recovery flow for web3 identities within the SoCon ecosystem. Leveraging a suite of OpenZeppelin standards, they ensure robust ownership mechanisms, fortified access control, and a user-friendly experience for seamless interactions. While currently accessible to a trusted register or invitation mode during the beta testing phase, SoCon is poised to transition towards a public registration system, welcoming users from all backgrounds to register on SoCon. We eagerly anticipate expanding the smart contracts architecture by incorporating additional verification contracts, exploring the EIP712 standards, and integrating ZK-Snarks verification contracts to enhance speed and efficiency."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},3140:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>r});const r=n.p+"assets/images/contract-architecture-4814405cd138883f564beeffc34b9912.png"},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>a});var r=n(6540);const i={},s=r.createContext(i);function o(e){const t=r.useContext(s);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:o(e.components),r.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
