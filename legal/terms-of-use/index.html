<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH Social Continent AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SOCIAL CONTINENT.</p>
<p>Except for any dispute in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, you and Social Continent waive your respective rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Pune, Maharashtra (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the rules of JAMS, which are available on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>JAMS website</strong></a>. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<p>YOU AND SOCIAL CONTINENT AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND SOCIAL CONTINENT AND THAT YOU AND SOCIAL CONTINENT WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms and the JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
<p>Any claim you may have arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred. You and Social Continent agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.

<p>These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California without resort to its conflict of law provisions.
